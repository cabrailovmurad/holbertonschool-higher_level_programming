# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This project is part of the Holberton School Higher Level Programming curriculum.  
In this project, we focus on lists and tuples in Python.

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What are lists and how to use them
- Differences and similarities between strings and lists
- What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
- How to use lists as stacks and queues
- What are list comprehensions and how to use them
- What are tuples and how to use them
- When to use tuples versus lists
- What is a sequence
- What is tuple packing
- What is sequence unpacking
- What is the `del` statement and how to use it

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
- Files must end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code should use the PEP 8 style (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Files
- `0-print_list_integer.py`: Function that prints all integers of a list.
- More files will be added as the project progresses.
