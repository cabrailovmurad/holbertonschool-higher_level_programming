# Python - More Data Structures

## Project Description
This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum.  
It covers advanced usage of Python data structures such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- How to use lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries
- How to use functions such as `map`, `reduce`, `filter`
- How to work with lambda expressions
- The difference between mutable and immutable types
- How to iterate through data structures effectively

## Files
All files are written in Python 3.8+ and are executable.  
Each file corresponds to a task from the project.

Example:
- `0-square_matrix_simple.py` â†’ Computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

## Requirements
- All code is written in Python 3
- Files are executable
- Followed PEP8 style guide

## Usage
To test a file, use:
```bash
./<filename>.py
